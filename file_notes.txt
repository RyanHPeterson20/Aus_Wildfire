Brief file notes and summaries:

1. AGU_viz.rmd
  - Visualizations for AGU 2024.
  - Used as baseline figures and plots.

2. CO_dataupdate.rmd
  - Data update to include indicator functions.
  - Includes response thresholds for logistic regression.
  - Combine with data_cleaning.rmd (and other data prep files.)

 . base_lasso.rmd (DELETED; redundant)
  - Replace with lasso_work.rmd
  - intitial work for LASSO models inside a markdown file
  - if chosen as our model convert to R script
    - Potentially change to R script anyway.

3. cluster_work.rmd
  - create manual time-constrained agglomerative clustering of response data.
  - this is all done manually since I don't necessarily like any of the existing R packages.

4. co_olr.R
  -olr anomaly and visualization file. 
  -use the olr_full.rda (R data file)
    -TODO: convert .rda to .csv for general use.

5. data_cleaning.rmd:
  - base data cleaning methods inside a markdown file.
  - needs conversion to R script.

6. eda_work.rmd
  - Exploratoty data analysis work.
  - (add more later.)

7. genlasso_func.R
  - Includes cv.fusedlasso() that performs cross-validation for fused lasso in gen lasso
  - Develops on existing cv that only works without predictors (e.g. signal trends)
    - Includes the use of predictors in k-fold CV. 

8. group_function.R
  - methods for creating groups of response and predictor data structures.
  - currently wip, needs to be flexible with respect to groups.
    - potentially combine with upated data functions so we can scale data correctly. 

9. lasso_cv.R
  - lasso cross-validation file

 . lasso_work.rmd

 . lasso_prediction.R

 . new_interaction.rmd
  - Interaction work for 5 continuous preds (CMI, OLR) and indicator functions (Nino, DMI).
  - Working through other response groupings:
    -Groups
  - Includes logistic regression (hierNet).
  - Works with hierNet (glinternet and RAMP to be tested later).

 . new_simple_model.R
  - R script for the simplified linear models
  - Includes validation and predictive analysis methods. 

 . pca_work.rmd: (DELETED; redundant)
  - file for initial work using PCA on our data sets.
  - If this works we will clean up the work here and create an R script.

 . prediction_work.rmd:
  - for working on prediction using clustered responses and fused lasso.
  - goal is to refine the prediction at this level of the hierarchical model.

 . predictionTest_function.R
  - R script that includes simplified versions of CRPS, interval scores and coverage
  - Needs added flexibility for distributions other than normal. 

 . residual.work.rmd
  - temp working file for exploring the residuals of our model.

Note: delete test_lasso_cv.R  when done with development.

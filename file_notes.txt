Brief file notes and summaries:

1. base_lasso.rmd
  - Replace with lasso_work.rmd
  - intitial work for LASSO models inside a markdown file
  - if chosen as our model convert to R script
    - Potentially change to R script anyway.

 . cluster_work.rmd
  - create manual time-constrained agglomerative clustering of response data.
  - this is all done manually since I don't necessarily like any of the existing R packages.

2. co_olr.R
  -olr anomaly and visualization file. 
  -use the olr_full.rda (R data file)
    -TODO: convert .rda to .csv for general use.

3. data_cleaning.rmd:
  - base data cleaning methods inside a markdown file.
  - needs conversion to R script.

4. new_simple_model.R
  - R script for the simplified linear models
  - Includes validation and predictive analysis methods. 

5. pca_work.rmd:
  - file for initial work using PCA on our data sets.
  - If this works we will clean up the work here and create an R script.

 . prediction_work.rmd:
  - for working on prediction using clustered responses and fused lasso.
  - goal is to refine the prediction at this level of the hierarchical model.

6. predictionTest_function.R
  - R script that includes simplified versions of CRPS, interval scores and coverage
  - Needs added flexibility for distributions other than normal.
